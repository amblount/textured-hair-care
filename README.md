Problems with this view

- No images with models featuring this hair type
- Difficult to understand what your hair type is without images, many to choose from
- I want to look at a picture and understand that I have this type of hair by looing at a model with hair like mine


#### View all products for selected hair type

Problems with this view

- Three of the views contain similar product recommendations for different hair types, this indicates the lack of differentiation of the different hair types and how particular products fit a certain hair type and why
- Feels like this is an ads generated platform and not a user data generated platform
- I have a coily hair type and the first page of products did not contain recommendations for products which I would actually use
- With the stay in place measures many people are going to be shopping online for hair products when they would customarily go into stores

#### Specific product view
![alt text](https://github.com/amblount/textured-hair-care/blob/master/specific-product-view.png"product feature list")

Problems with this view

- When I look at a product I am not sure why this product would work on my hair and why it is being recommended to me
- I am not sure how to use this product with my current hair routine
- This view does not have any information specific to my hair type relative to the product recommendation so it does not feel personalized
- I don't know how to use the product
